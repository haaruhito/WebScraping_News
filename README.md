# WebScraping_News
The aim of this project is to extract titles and content of a news website in order to find common words used in the news. The name of website is, https://www.foreigner.fi. We are extracting only National news from this website (https://www.foreigner.fi/blog/section/national). For this project, we have taken first 30 pages from the website. After extracting the data, we have cleaned the data and have done analysis to find unique words in news headlines and its content. The analysis has been then reflected via visualizations. 

The plots can be viewed properly via:
